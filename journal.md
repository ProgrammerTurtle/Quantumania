#### Total Time Spent - 40 Hours 


### July 21, 2025 - 8 hours spent

Today is the first day of designing my quantum delta project. Learning from the failures and successes of DoNotDelta, this printer aims to be a lot more functional in daily use. 

I started off by designing the frame out of 2040 extrusions. This frame is inspired by a delta project made by the user of 84Dragon, so thats why the corner joints look that way. 
My previous project, DoNotDelta, used a unibody printed piece for the top/bottom frame. While this is rigid and looks nice, it is awful to print and really limiting when it comes to servicing or making changes to the printer. I won't be doing that again.

That took about 3 hours as I had to redesign a few times to make sure I had the size right for the build volume - it's a lot larger than a normal delta needs to be. 

After that, I made the motor modules. These are double shear, 15 tooth, and awd. I copied the way I did double shear modules for donotdelta and just adapted the mounting. This took another 2 hours to get everything aligned.

For the final 3 hours, I did a bunch of research on available linear guide types and eventually decided on mgn12. These will be super stable at speed. On donotdelta, I used linear rods. Those are pretty nice but it makes the carriages very bulky and makes having an extrusion based frame pretty awkward.

Frame complete.

### July 25, 2025 - 10 hours spent

I took a couple days break to recover more from Open Sauce. 
Today I focused on the toolhead. I didn't take too many photos of the process as I was really concentrated, but I can go over each part. 

<img width="923" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e071a90e-84de-48a8-bea5-44103489f97b" />

I started by making essentially a panel sandwich. This will house the toolhead. The cutouts were influenced by the toolhead design - I started off with solid panels and ended up with these cutouts, I just forgot photos.

The toolhead is actually quite simple. It clamps the lancer long hotend (with an mze attached) to the top panel and then braces the nozzle off the bottom panel, while also mounting the boombox extruder. I added a lip to hold up the lower motor as this is a very heavy extruder. 

I also did the ducts today. This took about 5 revisions to get right, but I essentially ended up with long tubes that had vanes going down the center.

### July 30, 2025 - 14 hours spent

I didn't sleep much today.

I made the entire gantry referencing James Pray's delta effector and carriages. Carbon fiber tubing for the arms, carbon fiber sheet for the bed, printed effector. 
Once again I forgot to take photos of the process. But, I used Deadlock's delta calculators to figure out the optimal arm length and then basically just trial and errored until I was comfortable with the design. 
On DoNotDelta, I used printed arms rather than carbon fiber tubes - this was a mistake. Printed arms are heavy and very difficult to get consistent lengths with, whcih means the printer literally can't work correctly. At larger scales they are also way too weak. So, I am not doing that again either. 
Another thing I learned from DoNotDelta is that the mpjet joints should be double sheared. Having the mount on only one side makes it easy for the joints to flex, causing innacuracy.

The bed has a 24v silicone heater on it. This will probably become a pcb heater eventually. PCB heaters are both significantly lighter and significantly more power dense as I can extend to the whole bed but just add holes for the mounting.

With that, the printer was practically done besides a few finishing touches. Basically just giving everything clearance and mounting the endstops.

### July 31, 2025 - 8 Hours Spent

Today is the last day of highway so I really had to hurry things up. I had been journaling on a text file that isn't on the github as I wanted to keep this project private unil it was done.
I basically just spent the whole time making/optimizing the BOM, making the GitHub, and generating renders. Pretty happy with how this printer turned out for how fast I designed it.
The biggest change I made here was ordering frsme extrusions cut by misumi. With the tools I have available, it is very difficult to cut the extrusions square and at consistent lengths.



I spent a lot of time researching and networking with sponsors for this project but I will not be explicitly logging it as it wasn't solely focused on this project. But, I can comfortably say I spent multiple days worth of time doing this witb significantly reduced sleep.
